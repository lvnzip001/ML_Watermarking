# Robust and Hybrid Video Watermarking using SVD, DWT and Frame Difference
This repository is a partial implementation of the research paper titled 'A Robust Color Video Watermarking Technique Using DWT, SVD and Frame Diï¬€erence' which has been published in PReM17 Proceedings. The implementation has been done using Python programming language and utilizes the following libraries:

<ul>
  <li>Open CV</li>
  <li>Scipy</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Pywavelet</li>
</ul>

The code is divided into two parts - 
<ol>
  <li> <h4>Embedding algorithm</h4>
    This algorithm adds watermark to the video through the proposed algorithm</li>
  <li> <h4>Extraction algorithm </h4>
    This algorithm extracts the watermark image from the video through the proposed algorithm</li>
</ol>

Dataset folder contains all the paraphernalia for the project. Codes folder contains all the Python implementation codes.
